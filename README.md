# Paris-2024-Olympic-Data-Engineering-Project
This repository has Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games Datasets for use in Data Engineering Projects

# Overview
1. This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis and transformation in Azure Databricks using PySpark. The notebook focuses on:
2. Loading data from external sources (e.g., Azure Data Lake Storage, Blob Storage).
3. Data cleaning, transformation, and processing.
4. Schema definition and validation.
5. Writing the processed data to a target destination (e.g., Azure Synapse, Data Lake).

# Prerequisites
1. Azure Databricks workspace with an active cluster.
2. Access to the relevant data sources (e.g., Azure Data Lake, Blob Storage).
3. Necessary Azure credentials or service principals with appropriate permissions.

# Libraries installed:
1. PySpark

# Any additional libraries used in the notebook.
1. Steps in the Notebook
2. Setup and Configuration

# Initialize Spark session.
1. Set up connections to data sources (e.g., ADLS or Blob Storage).
2. Data Ingestion

# Load data from CSV, Parquet, or other formats.
1. Validate the data source connection.
2. Schema Definition
3. Define the schema using StructType or infer it automatically.
4. Data Transformation
5. Filter, group, or join datasets.
6. Perform column data type conversions or derive new columns.
7. Data Visualization
8. Display data with display() or generate charts.

# Data Output

# Save the processed data to Azure Synapse, ADLS, or Blob Storage.
